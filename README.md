### Data directory
For data tables, metadata, resources, etc. that are of broad interest to the analysis teams. Any changes or notable additions should be tracked and recorded in the data readme.

### BSI and GVHD directories
Analysis teams should keep most of their binaries, analysis scripts, data specific to the subgrouping, etc., within these directories.
